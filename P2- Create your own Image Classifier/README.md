# Create your own Image Classifier 🖼️

## Overview 📖
The project aimed to build an image classifier on the 102 Category Flower Dataset, and then predict new flower images using the trained model. The application trains a deep learning model on a data set of images and then uses the trained model to classify images.

## Objectives ✨

- Preparation of the Tensor data & label mapping
- Upload of the pre-trained model and preparation of the classifier
- Training and testing the network
